		<h1>Dear Git,</h1>
		<p>I admire your commitment. From the first commit, the second, and the third, you always know how to save my files. You’re a great listener, and care about the details of each version I send you. It’s all about the little things with you. To styling with css, or just adding a section on html, you want to be updated and informed of my life. While I admire your dedication, you must be aware of your stalker tendencies, the way you track all changes to my directory with a simple git add . and git commit. You permanently track my files from the –m “first commit” and to the final version.  You get even creepier by requiring my personal information such as name and e-mail with commitlog and git log. But it’s okay, because you keep me organized and up to date. Just don’t ask me for my home address. You can track all of my files with git add . or just one more file with git add second-file.html. Either way, you always care about what I have to say.</p>
